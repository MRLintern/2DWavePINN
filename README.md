# 2DWavePINN
---
## Introduction
---
* This project investigates how we can apply ___Physics-Informed Neural Networks___ to solving the __2D Wave Equation__.

## Theory
---
### The Wave Equation
* The wave equation is a __hyperbolic partial differential equation__ describing waves, including __traveling__ and __standing waves__.
* TODO.

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks
* ___Physics-Informed Neural Networks___ are a type of ___neural network___ that solve __differential equations__ by __embedding physical laws__ into the __loss function__ of the network.
* This means:
    * You don't need large datasets.
    * The model learns a *continuous solution* over the domain.
    * It generalizes well to unseen points in space and time.
* TODO.
      
## Requirements
---
* __Compiler__: `g++ 13.1.0`. A compiler that supports `C++17`.
* __OS__: Project will be developed on `Ubuntu 20.04`.
* __Eigen Template Library__: Version `3.3.7` for the Linear Algebra.
* __CMake__: version `4.0.2`.

## Getting and Using the Software
* TODO.
